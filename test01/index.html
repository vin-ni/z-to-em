Chapter 21<br />
<br />
It was then that the fox appeared.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; said the fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Good morning,&quot; the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.<br />
<br />
&quot;I am right here,&quot; the voice said, &quot;under the apple tree.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the little prince, and added, &quot;You are very pretty to look at.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am a fox,&quot; said the fox.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come and play with me,&quot; proposed the little prince. &quot;I am so unhappy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I cannot play with you,&quot; the fox said. &quot;I am not tamed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah! Please excuse me,&quot; said the little prince.<br />
<br />
But, after some thought, he added:<br />
<br />
&quot;What does that mean-- 'tame'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You do not live here,&quot; said the fox. &quot;What is it that you are looking for?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am looking for men,&quot; said the little prince. &quot;What does that mean-- 'tame'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Men,&quot; said the fox. &quot;They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; said the little prince. &quot;I am looking for friends. What does that mean-- 'tame'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is an act too often neglected,&quot; said the fox. It means to establish ties.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;'To establish ties'?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Just that,&quot; said the fox. &quot;To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hu ndred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am beginning to understand,&quot; said the little prince. &quot;There is a flower... I think that she has tamed me...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is possible,&quot; said the fox. &quot;On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, but this is not on the Earth!&quot; said the little prince.<br />
<br />
The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious.<br />
<br />
&quot;On another planet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are there hunters on this planet?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nothing is perfect,&quot; sighed the fox.<br />
<br />
But he came back to his idea.</p>
